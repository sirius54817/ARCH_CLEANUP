🚀 Arch Cleanup Script

Tired of your Arch Linux looking like a digital hoarder's paradise? Fear not! This script will purge your system of all the unnecessary junk, orphaned packages, and outdated logs, leaving it cleaner than your conscience after deleting browser history. 🧹

🎯 What This Script Does

✅ Nukes old pacman caches 🔥✅ Eradicates orphaned packages like they're unwanted guests 🏡❌✅ Wipes AUR cache (goodbye, ancient build files) 🚮✅ Compresses journal logs to free up space 📜✂️✅ Eliminates system logs (because who reads logs anyway?) 📄💨✅ Obliterates thumbnails, temp files, and user cache 🚀✅ Shows your disk space before and after, so you can flex your freed-up storage 💾💪

🛠️ Installation & Usage

chmod +x arch_cleanup.py  # Make it executable
sudo python3 arch_cleanup.py  # Run it like a boss

(sudo required for system-wide cleanup, because power!)

⚠️ Disclaimer

This script has the power to wipe things clean—so use it wisely! I'm not responsible if you accidentally summon the Linux gods by running this. 🙃

🏆 Why Use This?

Because running df -h and seeing 5GB+ freed up is satisfying.

Because a bloated Arch system is basically not Arch. 😎

Because you want to feel like a hacker while running Python scripts. 👨‍💻

Enjoy your clean, minimal, and bloat-free Arch Linux! 🎉
